# panneauxbiche
Display wild animal signs from OpenStreetMap, starting by hind, bat and toad.
Check http://panneauxbiche.com for the real-time generated map from OpenStreetMap.

This project started (as a joke) in may 2015 at SoTM-fr in Brest and the goal is to display all A15b road signs.

If you'd like to map the sign in OSM, please use hazard=animal_crossing. You can also specify the animal species with species=* cf. http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:species

I suggest you also use man_made=sign but the tags are still under discussion cf. http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/hazard#Animal_crossign
